# true-rng
True random number generation using a quantum computer.
Run ```python main.py``` and follow the prompts to run it. It is only tested in the IBM Quantum Lab environment.

This code works by putting a user defined number of qubits in superposition, and then measuring their states. By measuring their states, they are forced to collapse to either 1 or 0, with each outcome having an equal probability.
